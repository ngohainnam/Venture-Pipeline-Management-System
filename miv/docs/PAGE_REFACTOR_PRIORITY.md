# Page Refactor Priority

## Purpose and scope

This report audits the canonical active frontend route pages on
`refactor/miv-clean-baseline` under:

- `miv/app/dashboard/**/page.tsx`
- `miv/app/user-dashboard/**/page.tsx`
- `miv/app/auth/**/page.tsx`
- `miv/app/page.tsx`

The inventory was taken on 2026-07-25. Archived files, backups, alternate
implementations, test routes, and files outside the requested paths were not
counted. In particular, this excludes the archived/test material under
`miv/archive`, the removed `dashboard/test-environment` route, the removed
`app/test-*` routes, the archived capital-facilitation variants, the removed
dashboard backup, and the removed standalone Venture Intake route because it is
outside the requested path set.

No conclusion in this report authorizes Prompt 8 or a source-code change.

## Counting method

- **LOC** is the physical line count of the current file.
- **S** is the number of `useState` calls (one state value per call).
- **E** is the number of `useEffect` calls.
- **F** is the number of direct global `fetch(...)` call sites in the page.
  Calls hidden behind an API client are not counted as direct fetches. This is
  why `/dashboard/ventures` has `F=0` even though it loads data through
  `@/lib/api/ventures`.
- **D** is the number of dialog/modal JSX definitions in the page, including
  custom full-screen modal overlays. It is source-definition count, not the
  number of dialogs that a mapped list could create at runtime.
- **T** is the number of rendered HTML or UI-library table definitions.
- **C** is the number of rendered chart definitions. Recharts axes, legends,
  tooltips, and containers are not counted as separate charts. Two hand-built
  SVG/CSS chart definitions in each user-dashboard page are counted.
- **X** is the number of substantial inline data/render transformation blocks:
  a `.map`, `.filter`, `.reduce`, or `.sort` callback spanning at least six
  lines. This deliberately includes large repeated JSX mappings because those
  blocks increase the risk of changing page layout for mobile.
- **Logic mixed** indicates that domain calculations, data shaping, API
  orchestration, or mutation workflows live in the page alongside rendering.
- **Reuse** distinguishes a strong domain/page component boundary from use of
  UI primitives only. “None” means the page is largely raw JSX even if it uses
  icon components.
- **Static** describes the active page UI, not whether the file happens to
  contain static fixture data.

| C | Small and safe; no refactor needed | 11 |
| D | Duplicate, test-only, obsolete, or unclear | 1 |
| **Total** | **Active pages reviewed** | **40** |

## Refactor decisions and recommended order

The order below is a risk order, not an instruction to refactor every Category A
page in one change. Each page should retain its current route contract. Domain
logic/hooks should be separated before responsive layout work begins.

### Category A — must refactor before mobile work

| Order | Route | Refactor recommendation | Suggested extracted components/hooks | Mobile risk |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A01 | `/dashboard/due-diligence` | Split data/domain logic, list/detail modes, reports, and dialogs before any responsive redesign. | `useDueDiligenceData`, `dueDiligenceCalculations`, `DueDiligenceFilters`, `VentureDueDiligenceList`, `ChecklistTable`, `ReportConfigDialog`, `DueDiligenceItemDialogs` | Critical |
| A02 | `/dashboard/deal-flow` | Establish a page shell around a deal-flow feature and isolate score/mapping logic and each view/dialog. | `useDealFlow`, `dealFlowCalculations`, `DealFlowFilters`, `PipelineBoard`, `DealTable`, `DealDetailDialog`, `DealEditorDialog`, `StageDealsDialog` | Critical |
| A03 | `/dashboard/fund-management` | Divide by fund-management domain and move response shaping and status rules out of the renderer. | `useFundManagement`, `FundOverview`, `FundLifecyclePanel`, `LimitedPartnerTable`, `CapitalCallsTable`, `DistributionsTable`, `FundOperationsPanel`, fund dialogs | Critical |
| A04 | `/dashboard/team-management` | Create resource hooks/services and independent tab sections; extract all create/detail dialogs. | `useTeamMembers`, `useProjects`, `useAnnouncements`, `useTeamEvents`, `TeamMembersPanel`, `ProjectsPanel`, `AnnouncementsPanel`, `EventsPanel`, dialog components | Critical |
| A05 | `/dashboard` | Keep the existing enterprise components, but turn the page into an orchestration shell with one dashboard data hook and extracted summary/tab sections. | `useEnterpriseDashboardData`, `dashboardAggregates`, `DashboardHeader`, `DashboardKpis`, `VentureOverviewTab`, `DashboardFilterDialog` | High |
| A06 | `/dashboard/advanced-reports` | Separate data loading, report configuration/generation, chart rendering, and dashboard-builder behavior. | `useAdvancedReportsData`, `ReportFilters`, `ReportConfiguration`, `ReportChart`, `ReportSchedulePanel`, `DashboardBuilder`, `useDashboardLayout` | Critical |
| A07 | `/dashboard/investment-rounds` | Move venture-to-round conversion and risk/GEDSI calculations into domain helpers, then split list/table and dialogs. | `useInvestmentRounds`, `investmentRoundCalculations`, `RoundFilters`, `RoundCards`, `InvestmentRoundsTable`, `AddRoundDialog`, `RoundDetailDialog` | High |
| A08 | `/dashboard/exit-strategy` | Separate strategy transformation/scenario calculations from presentation and isolate each visualization and dialog. | `useExitStrategies`, `exitStrategyCalculations`, `ExitStrategyFilters`, `StrategyCards`, `ExitStrategyTable`, `ScenarioCharts`, `ScenarioPlannerDialog`, `PlanExitDialog` | High |
| A09 | `/dashboard/performance-analytics` | Extract analytics loading/polling and all generated insight calculations before changing the chart grid. | `usePerformanceAnalytics`, `performanceCalculations`, `AnalyticsKpis`, `TrendCharts`, `AIInsightsPanel`, `RiskAssessmentPanel`, `OptimisationPanel` | High |
| A10 | `/dashboard/portfolio` | Move company mapping/scoring and action workflows into a feature hook; replace custom overlays with isolated dialog components. | `usePortfolio`, `portfolioCalculations`, `PortfolioFilters`, `PortfolioGrid`, `CompanyDetailDialog`, `PortfolioActionDialog`, `PortfolioExportAction` | High |
| A11 | `/dashboard/system-settings` | Split each settings domain into a section/form and centralise save/load state in hooks or form controllers. | `useUserSettings`, `ProfileSettingsForm`, `PasswordForm`, `NotificationSettings`, `AccessibilitySettings`, `AppearanceSettings`, `DataSettings`, `SystemPerformancePanel` | High |
| A12 | `/dashboard/custom-dashboards` | Separate catalog/query state, mutations, dashboard editor forms, and chart/widget preview rendering. | `useCustomDashboards`, `DashboardFilters`, `DashboardCatalog`, `DashboardCard`, `DashboardEditorDialog`, `WidgetPreview`, `PortfolioChart` | High |
| A13 | `/dashboard/sustainability` | Extract sustainability derivations and chart-ready models, then componentise each analytics section. | `useSustainabilityData`, `sustainabilityCalculations`, `SustainabilityKpis`, `ESGRadar`, `CarbonCharts`, `NatureProjectsPanel`, `DigitalTwinPanel` | High |
| A14 | `/dashboard/capital-facilitation` | Move all venture-to-capital calculations into a domain adapter and split the request, investor, and timeline views. | `useCapitalFacilitation`, `capitalFacilitationCalculations`, `CapitalRequestList`, `CapitalRequestDetail`, `InvestorPartnersPanel`, `FundingTimeline` | High |
| A15 | `/dashboard/ventures/[id]` | Turn the route into data loading plus a composed venture-detail feature; move GEDSI and formatting logic out of JSX. | `useVentureDetail`, `ventureDetailCalculations`, `VentureHeader`, `VentureOverview`, `FinancialsPanel`, `GEDSIProfile`, `ActivityTimeline`, detail tab components | High |
| A16 | `/` | Break the long marketing page into semantic sections while preserving content and behavior; do this before mobile styling to avoid editing one 1,272-line JSX tree. | `MarketingHeader`, `HeroSection`, `PlatformFeatures`, `HowItWorks`, `ImpactMetrics`, `PricingSection`, `Testimonials`, `MarketingFooter`, `AccessibilityPanel` | High layout risk; low business risk |
| A17 | `/dashboard/calendar` | Extract calendar data/query state, filter controls, and each calendar/list representation before responsive work. | `useCalendarData`, `CalendarHeader`, `CalendarFilters`, `CalendarGrid`, `CalendarAgenda`, `EventCard`, `CalendarAnalytics` | High |
| A18 | `/dashboard/documents` | Separate query/upload/mutation logic and provide distinct desktop-table and mobile-card presentation components. | `useDocuments`, `useDocumentUpload`, `DocumentFilters`, `DocumentDropzone`, `DocumentTable`, `DocumentCards`, `DocumentAnalytics` | High |
| A19 | `/dashboard/workflows/[id]/builder` | Isolate the workflow model adapter and pointer/drag behavior from node editing and run history before deciding the mobile interaction model. | `useWorkflowBuilder`, `workflowDefinitionAdapter`, `WorkflowCanvas`, `WorkflowNode`, `NodeEditor`, `WorkflowToolbar`, `RunHistoryPanel` | Critical interaction risk |
| A20 | `/dashboard/social-impact` | Extract impact aggregations and chart models, then split overview, category, and venture sections. | `useSocialImpactData`, `socialImpactCalculations`, `ImpactKpis`, `ImpactCategoryChart`, `ImpactCategoryPanel`, `VentureImpactList` | High |
| A21 | `/dashboard/impact-reports` | Move report aggregations/export orchestration out of the page and componentise the chart/table sections. | `useImpactReportData`, `impactReportCalculations`, `ImpactReportKpis`, `ImpactTrendChart`, `GEDSIChart`, `SectorImpactTable`, `ReportExportAction` | High |
| A22 | `/dashboard/impact-documents` | Introduce a document API hook and shared document presentation before adapting the table for small screens. | `useImpactDocuments`, `DocumentStats`, `ImpactDocumentFilters`, `ImpactDocumentTable`, `ImpactDocumentCards`, `DocumentStatusAction` | High |

### Category B — should refactor later

| Order | Route | Refactor recommendation | Suggested extracted components/hooks | Mobile risk |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| B01 | `/dashboard/ai-analysis` | Keep functional for mobile work if necessary, then extract generated analysis logic and the controls/results split. | `useAIAnalysis`, `analysisCalculations`, `AnalysisControls`, `AnalysisResults`, `InsightList`, `RecommendationList` | Medium |
| B02 | `/dashboard/workflows/wizard` | After the workflow builder, extract step definitions and workflow payload construction so the step layout can evolve independently. | `useWorkflowWizard`, `WorkflowTemplateStep`, `WorkflowDetailsStep`, `WorkflowTriggerStep`, `WorkflowActionsStep`, `WorkflowReviewStep` | Medium-high |
| B03 | `/dashboard/workflows/[id]/monitor` | Extract data/run actions and stats, leaving the route as a compact monitor composition. | `useWorkflowMonitor`, `RunStats`, `RunList`, `RunDetail`, `WorkflowMonitorHeader` | Medium |
| B04 | `/user-dashboard/documents` | Reuse the document hook/dropzone/mobile cards created for admin documents instead of maintaining a separate raw implementation. | Shared `useDocuments`, `DocumentDropzone`, `UserDocumentCard`, `UploadProgressList`, `DocumentMessage` | Medium-high |
| B05 | `/dashboard/ventures` | Retain the shared API client and later separate query/summary state from desktop table and mobile cards. | `useVentureList`, `VentureFilters`, `VentureSummaryCards`, `VentureTable`, `VentureCards` | Medium |
| B06 | `/user-dashboard/profile` | Later consolidate profile/password requests and split the two forms; no prerequisite for the first mobile pass. | `useUserProfile`, `ProfileForm`, `ChangePasswordForm`, `FormStatusMessage` | Medium |

### Category C — small and safe; no refactor needed

| Route | Refactor recommendation | Suggested extracted components | Mobile risk | Recommended order |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/auth/login` | Keep as-is. A shared auth shell/password field is optional only if future auth screens create real duplication. | None now; optional `AuthCard` and `PasswordField` | Low | Do not include in Prompt 8 |
| `/auth/register` | Keep as-is; test the existing form responsively without structural refactoring. | None now; optional shared auth form primitives | Low | Do not include in Prompt 8 |
| `/dashboard/gedsi-tracker` | Keep the route wrapper exactly at this level of responsibility. | Already extracted: `GEDSITracker` | Low | Do not include in Prompt 8 |
| `/dashboard/help-support` | Keep as-is. Content arrays could reduce repetition, but extraction would not materially de-risk mobile work. | None required | Low | Do not include in Prompt 8 |
| `/dashboard/iris-metrics` | Keep as-is; use normal responsive-table treatment in place. | None required; optional `IRISMetricTable` only if reused | Low-medium | Do not include in Prompt 8 |
| `/dashboard/notifications` | Keep the route-level feature re-export. | Already extracted: notification feature page | Low | Do not include in Prompt 8 |
| `/dashboard/venture-intake` | Keep as-is; the complex form is already extracted and the remaining page is explanatory content. | Already extracted: `VentureIntakeForm` | Low | Do not include in Prompt 8 |
| `/dashboard/workflows` | Keep as-is. Two calls alone do not justify fragmenting this compact list page. | None required | Low-medium | Do not include in Prompt 8 |
| `/user-dashboard` | Keep as-is for now; it is a small static composition. Reassess only when fixture data is replaced with live dashboard data. | None required; optional chart components when data becomes live | Low-medium | Do not include in Prompt 8 |
| `/user-dashboard/diagnostics` | Keep as-is for now. The custom donut rendering is compact and the page has no request/state complexity. | None required | Low-medium | Do not include in Prompt 8 |
| `/user-dashboard/support` | Keep as-is. | None required | Low | Do not include in Prompt 8 |

### Category D — obsolete or unclear active implementation

| Route | Refactor recommendation | Suggested extracted components | Mobile risk | Recommended order |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/dashboard/diagnostics` | Do not refactor the page for mobile. The active route already delegates to `ReadinessTracker`; first confirm that the unused fixture/types/helpers are obsolete, then remove them in a separately authorised cleanup task. | Already extracted: `ReadinessTracker`; no new component needed | Low for the active UI; medium cleanup ambiguity | Exclude from Prompt 8 |

## Prompt 8 execution order

Prompt 8 should operate on one coherent page/feature slice at a time in this
order:

1. `/dashboard/due-diligence`
2. `/dashboard/deal-flow`
3. `/dashboard/fund-management`
4. `/dashboard/team-management`
5. `/dashboard`
6. `/dashboard/advanced-reports`
7. `/dashboard/investment-rounds`
8. `/dashboard/exit-strategy`
9. `/dashboard/performance-analytics`
10. `/dashboard/portfolio`
11. `/dashboard/system-settings`
12. `/dashboard/custom-dashboards`
13. `/dashboard/sustainability`
14. `/dashboard/capital-facilitation`
15. `/dashboard/ventures/[id]`
16. `/`
17. `/dashboard/calendar`
18. `/dashboard/documents`
19. `/dashboard/workflows/[id]/builder`
20. `/dashboard/social-impact`
21. `/dashboard/impact-reports`
22. `/dashboard/impact-documents`

After mobile-critical work is unblocked, the Category B follow-up order is:

1. `/dashboard/ai-analysis`
2. `/dashboard/workflows/wizard`
3. `/dashboard/workflows/[id]/monitor`
4. `/user-dashboard/documents`
5. `/dashboard/ventures`
6. `/user-dashboard/profile`

## Pages that should not be refactored

The following pages should not be included in Prompt 8:

- `/auth/login`
- `/auth/register`
- `/dashboard/gedsi-tracker`
- `/dashboard/help-support`
- `/dashboard/iris-metrics`
- `/dashboard/notifications`
- `/dashboard/venture-intake`
- `/dashboard/workflows`
- `/user-dashboard`
- `/user-dashboard/diagnostics`
- `/user-dashboard/support`
- `/dashboard/diagnostics` — exclude from page refactoring; handle only as a
  separately authorised dead-code cleanup after confirming the obsolete
  declarations are unused.

## Final totals

1. **Total active pages:** 40
2. **Category A:** 22
3. **Category B:** 6
4. **Category C:** 11
5. **Category D:** 1
6. **Recommended Prompt 8 execution order:** the 22 Category A routes in the
   order listed above, followed only later by the six Category B routes.
7. **Pages that should not be refactored:** the 11 Category C pages and the one
   Category D page listed above.
